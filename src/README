Artic - RSA Cryptography Demo

I wrote this code for my undergraduate Discrete Mathematics assignment a few years ago. It demonstrate sending and receiving files from two computers connected in a network. The sent files are encrypted using RSA.

I can't remember the details for compiling and running the program since it's a long time ago (I even used two spaces indentation in this code!!!).

This program contains an easter egg.
